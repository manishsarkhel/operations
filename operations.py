st.markdown("""
Welcome, Manager! This simulation runs instantly to test different production strategies.
Your goal is to meet customer demand efficiently by configuring your factory and choosing a strategy.
- **Takt Time**: The rate you *need* to produce to meet demand.
- **Bottleneck**: The slowest process that limits your factory's output.
- **Drum-Buffer-Rope (DBR)**: A method to manage production based on your bottleneck.

Set your parameters, run the simulation, and compare the results of a traditional **'Push'** system versus a **DBR** system.
